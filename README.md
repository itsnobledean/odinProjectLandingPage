# odinProjectLandingPage

This is my real attempt at creating this page. I deleted the first after realizing I didn't fully understand flexbox, nor flexgrid. I'll be looking to polish those skills, as well as practice centering divs.  
For some reason I have not dedicated time to practice building using flexbox. This will be a much needed challenge.

I'll be utilizing as much of github as possible by adding files, committing, and pushing.

I have three files; index.html, style.css, and index.js.

Well after watching this youtube video I now believe I should start over. It seems as I've made things harder on myself how I made my containers.
